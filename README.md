## What is WPDistillery

WP Distillery does all the work for you when setting up a new WordPress project with [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/). Simply add your preferred theme, plugins, and options into `config.yml` and you're good to go! With WPDistillery it won't take longer than 5 minutes until you can start working on your new WordPress project.

One simple command will:

- Install Scotch Box
- Install and update requirements on the local webserver
- Download, install, and configure WordPress
- Set WordPress options
- Install and activate your favorite WordPress theme (default: [WPSeed](https://wpseed.org))
- Remove default themes
- Install and activate the plugins defined in the config files
- Clean the contents, plugins, unused files, and other Wordpress defaults

You're able to adjust which of the above tasks will be executed. Simply set the desired tasks to `true` or `false` in the **Setup Options** section at the bottom of `config.yml`. All you need to do after customizing your config file is `vagrant up`. That's it! With that one single command WPDistillery will:

1. SSH to the VM
1. Update WP-CLI
1. Install and configure everything

It also comes with an optional auto-update function and integrated support for Windows. Check out the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

WPDistillery is fully compatible with [Scotchbox 3.0](https://box.scotch.io/)

## Demo

[![WPDistillery Setup Video](http://files.flurinduerst.ch/wpdistillery/demovideo_thumb2.png)](https://youtu.be/y1GtIiODsxM)

## Dependencies

- [ScotchBox](https://box.scotch.io) (using [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) & [Virtualbox](https://virtualbox.org))
- [Vagrant Hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`)

## Setup

To setup a new project running Scotch Box and WordPress, simply follow these steps:

1. In a terminal, run: `git clone https://github.com/flurinduerst/WPDistillery.git my-project`
2. Customize `wpdistillery/config.yml` to suit your needs. See [configuration file documentation](README_CONFIG.md).
3. Inside the `Vagrantfile` add your local URL at `config.vm.hostname`. This should be the same as `wpsettings:url:` in `config.yml`.
4. Run `vagrant up` from where your `Vagrantfile` is.

Done! You can now access your project at the local URL (for example `yoursite.vm`) defined in **Step 3**. (or at http://192.168.33.10/)

**Note:** Currently there's an [issue](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box/issues/296) related to [ScotchBox](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box) that hinders Vagrant from mounting VirtualBox Shared folders. The solution is to install [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) before running vagrant. This will install the correct vbguest package into the box:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant vbguest
```

### Windows Users

Windows users may wish to `vagrant plugin install vagrant-winnfsd` before `vagrant up` for a moderate speed increase on sites with a lot of files. WPDistillery will detect **WinNFSd** support if needed. See [Vagrant WinNFSd](https://github.com/winnfsd/vagrant-winnfsd) for more information.

## Additional Information

### WPDistillery with WP-Multisite

Using this [Pull Request](https://github.com/flurinduerst/WPDistillery/pull/45) you can add multisite capability for your project. We [decided](https://github.com/flurinduerst/WPDistillery/issues/59) to not merge the PR to keep WPDistillery as clean as it is.

### Auto Update WordPress and Plugins

If you want to automatically update WordPress and all Plugins on every `vagrant up` you can remove the comment character at line 26 inside the Vagrantfile.

### Windows Support

Using Windows? No Problem! WPDistillery will detect if you're using Windows and if so, automatically convert all files using dos2unix.

### Basic Vagrant Commands

- `vagrant up` will start the machine. The first ever `vagrant up` in your project will also install Scotch Box and execute provisioning.
- `vagrant provision` will execute provisioning. This is where WPDistillery runs its core function which is installing and configuring WordPress according to `config.yml`. Before that, it will also update WP-CLI and set the upload size to 64MB. Normally `vagrant provision` should not be executed manually but can be used to re-run the WPDistillery setup in case you want to re-install WordPress.
- `vagrant reload` will restart Vagrant. This is required for changes made in the `Vagrantfile` to take effect.
- `vagrant halt` will shut down the virtual machine.
- `vagrant destroy` will destroy all the resources related to the current virtual machine. This action is not reversable.

 More informations can be found at [vagrantup.com](https://vagrantup.com).

## Troubleshooting

Something went wrong within the WPDistillery setup. I'd like to restart the setup:

- Fix your setting (probably in `wpdistillery/config.yml` or `Vagrantfile`)
- Remove all tables from the `scotchbox` database
- Remove the `public` folder
- Run `vagrant reload --provision`
